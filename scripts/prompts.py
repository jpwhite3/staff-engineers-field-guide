    <Context>
    You’ve been given a collection of short-form technical articles intended for staff-level engineers and technical practitioners. Each article introduces an important concept or practice, but suffers from a lack of depth, context, and actionable insight. Your task is to rewrite each article to significantly improve its usefulness and impact, while maintaining the original tone (friendly, clear, professional).
    </Context>

    <Instructions>
    1. Conduct deep research on the subject in the provided article, through the practical lens of a "staff engineer" (as defined in the book "The Staff Engineer's Path")
    2. Strengthen the introduction by making the topic relevant to the reader’s work and including real-world implications or risks of not understanding the concept.
    3.	Deepen the conceptual sections by:
        - Expand the abstract into more detailed explanations of key terms and concepts in depth using new terminology where necessary (e.g., ‘machine learning’ becomes a broad overview with subtopics like regression, classification etc.).- Adding more nuanced explanations of terms and types.
        - Including analogies, examples, or metaphors to aid understanding.
        - Exploring adjacent or underlying concepts where appropriate.
    4.	Add multiple real-world examples, ideally from different domains or industries to show broad applicability.
    5.	Expand the practical application section with:
        - Step-by-step advice or frameworks engineers can follow.
        - Pitfalls and anti-patterns with suggested solutions.
        - Tooling or processes that can help.
    6.	If a teaching or activity section is present, enhance it with:
        - Reflection or debrief prompts.
        - Suggestions for adapting it to different learning styles or audiences.
        - Ideas for follow-up or deeper learning.
    7.	End with a motivating call to action, highlighting how mastering this concept can improve systems, collaboration, and outcomes. This encourages engagement and helps to motivate the reader. The call should be clear about what they can expect from this article (e.g., understanding bias in ML), how it will benefit them if understood correctly or not understandable at all due diligence is needed beforehand, etc.
    8. Write in clear, direct language. Use markdown headings. Be generous with real examples. Use narrative paragraphs over bulleted lists when appropriate. Ensure the revised article is 2x to 3x the length of the original if needed, aiming for richness over brevity.
    9. Finally, ensure the response is **only** in valid Markdown format without any introductory text, explanations, or additional comments. Do not include phrases like 'Here is the rewritten article'. Or other acknowledgements of any kind.
