# Psychological Safety & Trust in Teams

Imagine walking into a room full of your colleagues, with the task of presenting an innovative idea that could change how you all work. Now imagine two scenarios: In one, everyone is listening intently, asking questions to understand better; in the other, people are rolling their eyes and waiting for you to finish so they can dismiss it. Which environment would make you feel more comfortable sharing your ideas? This difference boils down to **psychological safety**—a crucial element of successful engineering teams.

Psychological safety is a concept that was popularized by Amy Edmondson, an organizational behavior expert at Harvard Business School. It refers to a team's shared belief that the workplace is safe for interpersonal risk-taking. In other words, it’s when people feel comfortable expressing ideas, asking questions, or admitting mistakes without fear of negative consequences.

Why does psychological safety matter? Teams with high levels of psychological safety tend to be more innovative and productive. They are able to experiment, learn from their failures, and improve continuously because team members trust one another enough to take risks together.

## Key Takeaways

- **Psychological Safety** allows team members to express ideas without fear of embarrassment.
- Trust fosters collaboration and innovation by making people feel safe to experiment.
- Leaders play a crucial role in establishing psychological safety through their actions and attitudes.
- Lack of psychological safety can lead to missed opportunities and decreased team performance.

## Practical Applications

As a staff engineer, you’re often involved in cross-functional teams where trust and openness are paramount. Here’s how you can apply the concept of psychological safety:

- **Lead by Example**: Show vulnerability when appropriate. Admitting your own mistakes or uncertainties encourages others to do the same.
  
  *Example*: "I'm not sure about this solution, but let's explore it together."

- **Encourage Participation**: Create space for everyone’s voice in meetings and discussions. This might involve specifically asking quieter team members for their input.

  *Example*: Use a round-robin format during brainstorming sessions to ensure each member contributes.

- **Provide Constructive Feedback**: Offer feedback that focuses on the idea, not the person, and always frame it positively. 

  *Example*: "I think this approach could be more efficient if we consider..."

- **Celebrate Failures as Learning Opportunities**: Share stories of past failures and what was learned from them to normalize mistakes.

## Common Pitfalls & How to Avoid Them

Here are some common pitfalls that can undermine psychological safety, along with strategies for avoiding them:

- **Judgmental Behavior**: Criticizing team members publicly or harshly can erode trust.
  
  *Solution*: Offer feedback privately and focus on solutions rather than blame.

- **Ignoring Contributions**: Overlooking input from certain team members can stifle creativity and participation.

  *Solution*: Make a conscious effort to acknowledge all contributions, regardless of their source.

- **Overemphasis on Results**: Constantly focusing on outcomes at the expense of processes can discourage risk-taking.

  *Solution*: Balance discussions about results with an exploration of learning and innovation processes.

## How to Teach This to Others (Game or Activity!)

**Activity: "The Safe Space Game"**

1. **Objective**: Create a mini-environment where team members practice psychological safety.
   
2. **Setup**: 
   - Gather the team in a comfortable setting.
   - Explain that no idea is “stupid” and everyone’s input is valued.

3. **Execution**:
   - Give each participant three minutes to share an idea related to their work, however unconventional it might be.
   - The rest of the group can ask clarifying questions but not critique or judge the ideas.

4. **Debrief**: 
   - Discuss how it felt to share without fear of judgment.
   - Reflect on what could be done in everyday team settings to replicate this safe environment.
