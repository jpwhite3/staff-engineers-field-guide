An XP Practice, _Whole Team_ refers to the idea that the team involved in building an application or delivering a project is the whole team. If the project needs UI design, or testing, or data modeling, the individuals with those skills are on the team. Having a whole team (also known as a multi-disciplinary team) on a project ensures it has the resources it needs to be completed. It may be impossible within some organizations for every team to be comprised of a whole team in this fashion, but for projects that are critical to the organization, this approach will improve the odds of project success.
