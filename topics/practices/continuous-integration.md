Continuous Integration is an XP practice that ensures problems with the full system are detected as soon after they are introduced as possible. It refers to automatically building and testing the full system (_integrating_ the system with all of its dependencies) after every change (typically in response to every source control check-in). _Continuous_ integration takes the practice of having a _daily build_, once considered a best practice to strive for, to the extreme. The result is the shortest possible [feedback](/values/feedback) loop between problems being introduced into the system and their being detected, automatically.
