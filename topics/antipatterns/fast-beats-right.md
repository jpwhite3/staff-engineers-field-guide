The Fast Beats Right antipattern alleges that it is always better to just get something done, regardless of quality, than to invest any effort into doing the job right.  In software development, this quickly leads to taking on [Technical Debt](/terms/technical-debt), which can be useful and worthwhile in order to meet short-term deadlines.  However, unless it is paid down quickly, its long-term consequences can eventually lead to project failure.
