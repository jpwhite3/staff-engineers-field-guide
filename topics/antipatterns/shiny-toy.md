The Shiny Toy anti-pattern refers to the practice of always thinking today's problems can all be solved by the latest bleeding-edge tool, technique, or library. While it's true, the software industry is constantly trying to improve and evolve, new approaches almost always bring new headaches along with any advances they make in functionality or productivity. Depending on your application and organization's tolerance for risk, it may make sense to wait to integrate new libraries into your application until they've been proven in production.
