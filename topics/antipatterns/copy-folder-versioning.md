Copy Folder Versioning is a software development anti-pattern in which source code is updated by simply making copies of the folder in which the code currently resides. This results in a tangled mess of folders, usually without any clear indication of which is the most recent, and no version history or reliable means of rolling back code or seeing when a particular change was introduced, or what files it touched.
