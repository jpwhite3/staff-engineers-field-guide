# Cognitive Biases in Engineering

In the fast-paced world of engineering, our brains often play tricks on us. Imagine you're building a ship but halfway through, you realize there's a better design. However, because so much effort has already gone into the current one, it’s hard to abandon it. That's the **sunk cost fallacy** in action—a trap where past investments of time or money influence our decisions, even when continuing isn't the best choice.

Then there's **confirmation bias**, which is like wearing blinders that only let you see what matches your existing beliefs. If an engineer prefers a certain programming language and keeps finding articles supporting its superiority, they might ignore evidence to the contrary. This bias can lead to missed opportunities for improvement or innovation.

Finally, consider **survivorship bias**. When we look at successful projects and try to model them without considering the failures that didn’t make it past the drawing board, we miss a crucial part of the picture. It’s like only admiring ships that made it across the ocean while ignoring those that sank—valuable lessons are lost in the process.

## Key Takeaways

- **Sunk Cost Fallacy**: Don't let past investments dictate future decisions.
- **Confirmation Bias**: Seek diverse viewpoints to avoid reinforcing pre-existing beliefs.
- **Survivorship Bias**: Evaluate both successes and failures for a complete understanding.

## Practical Applications

### How does this concept apply to a Staff Engineer’s daily work?

For a staff engineer, recognizing these biases is crucial:

- When deciding whether to continue investing in a project that's not yielding results, ask yourself if you're influenced by the sunk cost fallacy. Sometimes, cutting losses and starting fresh can save time and resources.
  
- In code reviews or when proposing new technologies, actively seek out evidence both for and against your ideas to counteract confirmation bias. This could mean asking a colleague with an opposing view to present their case.

- When studying successful projects within the company, dig deeper to find what didn’t work in other initiatives. Analyzing failures helps refine future strategies and avoid repeating past mistakes—a lesson from survivorship bias.

**Example**: A staff engineer is leading a team on developing a new feature. They notice that initial prototypes aren't meeting performance benchmarks but have already invested significant time. Recognizing the sunk cost fallacy, they decide to pivot to a more promising approach, saving weeks of work in the long run.

## Common Pitfalls & How to Avoid Them

- **Ignoring Evidence**: Fall into confirmation bias by only considering data that supports your hypothesis. To avoid this, establish a habit of critically reviewing both supporting and opposing evidence.

- **Overvaluing Success Stories**: Relying too heavily on survivorship bias can lead you to overlook the broader context. Always analyze both success stories and failures when making decisions.

- **Emotional Attachment to Decisions**: Emotional investment in previous decisions might cloud judgment. Regularly re-evaluate projects with fresh eyes and encourage a culture where changing direction is seen as a strength, not failure.

## How to Teach This to Others (Game or Activity!)

### The "Bias Breaker" Challenge

**Objective**: To identify cognitive biases in decision-making scenarios and find ways to counteract them.

**Duration**: 10 minutes

1. **Setup**: Divide participants into small groups.
   
2. **Scenario Cards**: Provide each group with cards describing different project decisions that are influenced by one or more cognitive biases (sunk cost, confirmation bias, survivorship bias).

3. **Analysis**: Groups analyze their card to identify the bias at play and brainstorm strategies to mitigate its effect.

4. **Presentation**: Each group presents their scenario and discusses how recognizing the bias can lead to better decision-making.

5. **Debrief**: Open floor for discussion on insights gained and share additional real-life examples of these biases in engineering contexts.

By understanding these common cognitive pitfalls, staff engineers can lead more effectively, making decisions that are not only data-driven but also free of hidden biases. This not only fosters innovation but also builds a resilient and adaptive engineering culture.
