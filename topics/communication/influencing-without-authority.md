# Influencing Without Authority

In the world of software engineering and beyond, influence is a subtle art. It's particularly crucial for staff engineers who might not always have direct authority over their teams or projects but still need to drive change, encourage collaboration, and foster innovation. Understanding how to wield influence effectively can make all the difference in achieving your goals. Let’s dive into this fascinating subject, drawing on insights from Chris Voss, a master negotiator whose techniques offer valuable lessons for engineers.

## Key Takeaways

- **Leverage Tactical Empathy**: Understand others' perspectives and feelings without necessarily agreeing with them.
- **Use Mirroring and Labeling**: Reflect what you hear to show understanding and name emotions or actions to clarify intentions.
- **Employ Calibrated Questions**: Ask open-ended questions that encourage deeper thinking and engagement.

## Practical Applications

As a staff engineer, influencing without authority is often part of your daily work. Here are some real-world examples:

- **Propose Improvements**: When suggesting a new technology stack or process improvement, frame it in terms of how it benefits the team or project outcomes rather than presenting it as just an alternative.
  
  ```markdown
  - "This tool can reduce our deployment time by 20%, freeing up resources for more critical tasks."
  ```

- **Facilitate Collaboration**: Use your understanding of different team dynamics to align group efforts toward common goals.

  Example: During a cross-team meeting, you notice one group is hesitant about adopting a new practice. By mirroring their concerns and labeling them as valid, "It seems like you're worried this might disrupt your current workflow," you open the door for a constructive discussion on mitigating those disruptions.

- **Drive Technical Decisions**: When advocating for architectural changes, use calibrated questions to involve others in the decision-making process:

  ```markdown
  - "What potential challenges do you foresee with this approach?"
  - "How could this change impact our current delivery timelines?"
  ```

## Common Pitfalls & How to Avoid Them

- **Overstepping Boundaries**: Be cautious not to come across as authoritative. Instead, focus on collaborative problem-solving.

  Example: If a team member seems resistant, instead of insisting they adopt your idea, ask what concerns they have and how you might address them together.

- **Ignoring Feedback**: Make sure to actively listen and respond to feedback rather than dismissing it outright.

  Solution: After sharing an idea, pause to invite input with questions like, "How do you feel about this direction?"

- **Failing to Build Trust**: Influence is built on trust. Be consistent in your interactions and follow through on commitments.

  Action: Always be transparent about what you know and don’t know, which builds credibility over time.

## How to Teach This to Others (Game or Activity!)

**Role Play Negotiation Exercise**

1. **Setup**: Split participants into pairs. One person takes on the role of a staff engineer advocating for a change, while the other is skeptical.
2. **Objective**: The engineer must use tactical empathy, mirroring, labeling, and calibrated questions to win over their peer.
3. **Duration**: 10-15 minutes per pair.

- **Example Scenario**: Introducing a new coding standard that the team needs to adopt.

**Debrief**: After the exercise, discuss what strategies were effective and why. Encourage participants to share how they felt during the interaction and any insights gained about influencing without authority.
