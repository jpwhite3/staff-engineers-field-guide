Respect is one of the [values of Extreme Programming](http://www.extremeprogramming.org/values.html):

_Everyone gives and feels the respect they deserve as a valued team member.  Everyone contributes value even if it's simply enthusiasm.  Developers respect the expertise of the customers and vice versa.  Management respects our right to accept responsibility and receive authority over our own work._

Team members give and expect to be treated with respect.  This includes respecting others' ideas during retrospectives or while pair programming, as well as expecting respect from customers and management.  If mistakes are made, the underlying problems should be addressed respectfully.  Management should respect the team's ability to make its own decisions, and to allow the team to maintain a sustainable pace by avoiding the temptation to have the team work overtime.
