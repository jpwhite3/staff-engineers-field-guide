The SOLID principles of Object Oriented Design include these five principles:

[SRP - Single Responsibility Principle](/principles/single-responsibility-principle)

[OCP - Open/Closed Principle](/principles/open-closed-principle)

[LSP - Liskov Substitution Principle](/principles/liskov-substitution-principle)

[ISP - Interface Segregation Principle](/principles/interface-segregation)

[DIP - Dependency Inversion Principle](/principles/dependency-inversion-principle)

Generally, software should be written as simply as possible in order to produce the desired result.  However, once updating the software becomes painful, the software's design should be adjusted to eliminate the pain.  Often, these principles, in addition to the more general [Don't Repeat Yourself principle](/principles/dont-repeat-yourself), can be used as a guide while refactoring the software into a better design.
