# Anti-Corruption Layers: Protecting Your Domain Model

## Date: 2023-10-27

## Description: Anti-Corruption Layers (ACLs) are a critical defense against the creeping influence of external systems and models within a domain-driven design (DDD) context. Ignoring them can lead to brittle, inconsistent, and ultimately unusable domain models.

### The Problem: Contextual Contamination

Imagine a large e-commerce platform. Its "Orders" domain model represents the complex process of placing and fulfilling customer orders. It includes concepts like order states, shipping addresses, payment methods, and inventory management. Now, consider a third-party logistics (3PL) provider’s API that provides real-time tracking updates for shipments. If you simply integrate this API directly into your "Orders" domain model, you’re inviting chaos. The 3PL's API likely uses terms like “shipment,” “tracking number,” and “location” – concepts that might conflict with, or be entirely irrelevant to, your domain’s definitions of “order,” “shipping event,” and “delivery location.” Without proper safeguards, you risk:

- **Semantic Drift:** The meaning of terms changes as they’re interpreted through the lens of the external system.
- **Increased Complexity:** You end up translating between two entirely different models, adding layers of abstraction that obscure the core logic.
- **Brittle Systems:** Changes to the 3PL’s API can easily break your domain model if it’s not carefully protected.
- **Reduced Business Understanding:** Developers become entangled in technical details of an external system, diminishing their understanding of the core business rules.

This is where Anti-Corruption Layers (ACLs) come in. An ACL acts as a buffer, shielding your core domain model from the influence of external systems. It's not a single pattern, but a strategic approach leveraging several design patterns to ensure a clean and consistent interaction.

### Core Concepts and Patterns

An ACL is built upon a combination of patterns to handle the complexities of interacting with external systems. The primary patterns involved are:

- **Facade Pattern:** The facade provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem (the 3PL API). It abstracts away the details of the API, presenting a more consistent and user-friendly view to your domain model. The facade doesn't understand the internal workings of the 3PL; it simply calls the appropriate methods on the API.
- **Adapter Pattern:** The adapter transforms the interface of the 3PL API into a format that your domain model can understand. This is essential because APIs rarely align perfectly with your domain's concepts. For example, the 3PL API might return location data in latitude and longitude, while your domain model uses address components (street, city, state, zip). The adapter converts between these representations.
- **Map/Translate Pattern:** This is often a crucial element that explicitly maps domain-specific terms to the terminology of the external system, and vice versa. For instance, “Shipment Status” from the 3PL might be translated to “Order Fulfillment Stage” within your domain model.
- **Entity Aggregation:** Aggregating relevant information from the 3PL’s response into a new entity that aligns more closely with your domain model. Instead of simply passing the raw shipment data, you might create an “OrderShipment” entity with only the relevant fields for your use cases.

### Real-World Examples

1.  **Financial Services - Fraud Detection:** A banking system integrates with a third-party fraud detection service. The fraud service uses terms like "transaction risk score" and "suspicious activity." An ACL would translate these to “order risk” and “potential fraud event” within the bank’s core order management domain.
2.  **Healthcare - Patient Monitoring:** A hospital system integrates with a remote patient monitoring device. The device transmits sensor data in units like "heart rate bpm" and "blood pressure mmHg." The ACL transforms these into the hospital’s standard “vital signs” entities.
3.  **Supply Chain – Inventory Management:** A manufacturer connects with a logistics provider. The provider’s data includes “pallet count” and “box dimensions.” The ACL maps these to the manufacturer’s “inventory unit” entities.

### Practical Application: A Step-by-Step Guide

1.  **Identify External Boundaries:** Clearly define the scope of the external system and its relevant concepts.
2.  **Analyze Terminology Mismatches:** Conduct a thorough analysis of the terminology used by the external system and your domain model. Create a glossary of key differences.
3.  **Design the Facade:** Create a facade that hides the complexities of the external API, providing a simplified interface for your domain model.
4.  **Implement Adapters:** Develop adapters to transform data between the two systems.
5.  **Establish a Mapping Strategy:** Create a clear mapping strategy, documenting all translations and transformations.
6.  **Test Thoroughly:** Implement rigorous testing to ensure that data is correctly translated and that the ACL is functioning as expected.

### Pitfalls and Anti-Patterns

- **Ignoring the ACL:** Trying to directly integrate external APIs into your domain model is a recipe for disaster.
- **Over-Engineering:** Creating overly complex adapters and mappings can add unnecessary overhead. Strive for simplicity.
- **Lack of Documentation:** Without clear documentation, the ACL becomes a black box, making it difficult to maintain and evolve.

### Conclusion: Mastering Anti-Corruption Layers

Anti-Corruption Layers are a fundamental defense against the inherent risks of integrating external systems. By thoughtfully applying these patterns, you can protect your domain model, improve its consistency, and reduce the likelihood of integration-related problems. Mastering ACLs enables you to build more robust, maintainable, and ultimately, more valuable systems. Failure to understand and implement ACLs will invariably lead to technical debt, wasted effort, and potentially, critical business vulnerabilities.

### Call to Action: Begin Assessing Your Integrations

Take a critical look at your current integrations. Are you relying on direct API calls within your domain model? If so, it’s time to introduce an ACL. Start small, focusing on the most critical integrations. By proactively implementing this defense, you’ll be well on your way to building a more resilient and understandable software architecture.
