# The Business of Engineering

For many engineers, the "business" is a mysterious black box. It's where the requirements come from and where the money appears. As a Staff Engineer, you can no longer afford this perspective. You must step inside the box. Your role is to be a bridge between the world of technology and the world of business strategy, ensuring that the work your teams are doing is not just technically sound, but is also a powerful driver of the company's success.

This means learning to speak a new languageâ€”the language of revenue, costs, risk, and customer value. It means understanding how your company makes money, who its customers are, and how it competes in the market. It requires you to lift your gaze from the codebase and see the larger system in which your technology operates.

In this chapter, we will explore what it means to be a business-minded engineer. You will learn how to translate business strategy into technical reality, how to pitch your ideas in a way that executives will understand and support, and how to manage the economic realities of building software in the cloud. You will learn to see your work not as a cost center, but as a strategic investment in the company's future.
