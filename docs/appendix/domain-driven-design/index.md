# Domain-Driven Design: Aligning Software with Business Reality

Domain-Driven Design (DDD) provides a framework for tackling complexity in the heart of software. As a Staff Engineer, DDD helps you bridge the gap between technical implementation and business requirements, creating systems that evolve with the domain they serve.
