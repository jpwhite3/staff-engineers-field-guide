# Engineering Laws & Principles: Universal Truths for Technical Leaders

Certain laws and principles govern how software systems behave and how engineering organizations function. Understanding these universal truths helps staff engineers make better architectural decisions, predict system behavior, and avoid common pitfalls.

!!! info "Navigation Approach"
    This collection covers fundamental laws that shape software engineering. Each law includes both theoretical understanding and practical application guidance for technical leaders.

!!! note "Expanding the Collection"
    Additional engineering laws and principles will be added to this collection, including:
    
    **Organizational Dynamics:**
    - Conway's Law (system design reflects communication structure)
    - Parkinson's Law (work expands to fill available time)
    - Brooks' Law (adding people to late projects makes them later)
    
    **System Architecture:**
    - Postel's Law (be conservative in output, liberal in input)
    - Hyrum's Law (all observable behaviors become dependencies)
    - Gall's Law (complex systems evolve from simple ones)
    
    **Performance & Optimization:**
    - Knuth's Premature Optimization Law
    - Amdahl's Law (parallel processing limitations)
    - Little's Law (queuing theory fundamentals)
