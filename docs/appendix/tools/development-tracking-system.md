# Technical Leadership Development Tracking System

## Introduction: Measuring What Matters for Growth

Technical leadership development isn't like learning a programming language where you can measure progress through completed tutorials or passing tests. It's a complex, multi-dimensional journey where growth often happens gradually and becomes visible only when you're faced with challenges that require new capabilities.

This tracking system provides structured approaches for measuring your development across the core competencies of technical leadership, helping you identify progress patterns, celebrate growth, and maintain momentum toward your goals.

## Individual Development Tracking

### Competency Evolution Map

Track your progression through the five stages of competency development:

**1. Unconscious Incompetence → 2. Conscious Incompetence → 3. Conscious Competence → 4. Unconscious Competence → 5. Teaching Others**

#### Tracking Template

| Competency                  | 6 Months Ago                    | Current Level           | Evidence of Progress                      | Next Development Target        |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Technical Architecture      | 2 - Learning gaps               | 3 - Applying frameworks | Led service redesign project              | 4 - Intuitive design decisions |
| Strategic Thinking          | 1 - Didn't recognize importance | 2 - Studying frameworks | Reading "Good Strategy Bad Strategy"      | 3 - Applying to projects       |
| Influence Without Authority | 3 - Using techniques            | 4 - Natural application | Successfully drove API standards adoption | 5 - Mentoring others           |
