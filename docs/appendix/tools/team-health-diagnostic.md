# Team Health Diagnostic: A Comprehensive Assessment Framework

## Introduction: Beyond Velocity Metrics

Most engineering teams measure their effectiveness through velocity, deployment frequency, and bug counts. While these metrics matter, they miss the deeper patterns that determine whether teams can sustainably deliver value, adapt to change, and grow their capabilities over time.

This team health diagnostic evaluates the systemic patterns that drive high performance: psychological safety, technical practices, communication effectiveness, goal alignment, and cultural health. It's designed specifically for engineering teams who want to understand not just what they're delivering, but how well they're positioned for long-term success.

## How to Use This Diagnostic

### Recommended Process
1. **Individual Assessment**: Each team member completes the assessment independently
2. **Aggregate Results**: Compile responses to identify patterns and variations
3. **Team Discussion**: Discuss results together, focusing on improvement opportunities
4. **Action Planning**: Identify 2-3 high-impact improvements to implement
5. **Regular Check-ins**: Reassess quarterly and track progress over time

### Scoring Guidelines
- **5 - Excellent**: This is a team strength that others could learn from
- **4 - Good**: Generally working well with minor improvement opportunities  
- **3 - Adequate**: Functional but with clear opportunities for enhancement
- **2 - Needs Improvement**: Creating friction or limiting team effectiveness
- **1 - Critical Issue**: Actively undermining team performance and must be addressed

## Assessment Domains

                              |------------------------|
                              |                        |
Low Performance (1.0-3.9)    |  Struggling Teams      |  Inconsistent Teams  
                              |  (Multiple challenges, |  (Some strengths,
                              |   needs intervention)  |   some challenges)

                              (1.0-3.9)              (4.0-5.0)
```

**Performance** = Average of Domains 2, 4, 6 (Technical Excellence, Goal Alignment, Operational Excellence)
**Sustainability** = Average of Domains 1, 3, 5 (Psychological Safety, Communication, Growth)

### Interpretation Guide

**Thriving Teams (High Sustainability, Low-Moderate Performance)**
Your team has excellent fundamentals but may need focus on delivery practices or technical excellence. These teams often become high-performing with targeted improvements.

*Focus Areas:* Technical practices, delivery processes, goal clarity

**High-Performing Teams (High Performance, High Sustainability)**
Your team is operating at an exceptional level across all dimensions. Focus on maintaining excellence and sharing practices with other teams.

*Focus Areas:* Knowledge sharing, mentoring other teams, innovation

**Struggling Teams (Low Performance, Low Sustainability)**  
Multiple fundamental issues need attention. Prioritize psychological safety and communication before focusing on technical practices.

*Focus Areas:* Leadership support, psychological safety, basic processes

**Inconsistent Teams (High Performance, Low Sustainability)**
You're delivering results but may be doing so unsustainably. Risk of burnout and team member departure.

*Focus Areas:* Team dynamics, communication, sustainable practices

## Action Planning Framework

### Priority Matrix
Based on your assessment, identify improvement priorities:

**High Impact, High Urgency (Address Immediately):**
- Any domain scoring below 2.0
- Critical issues affecting team delivery or morale

**High Impact, Low Urgency (Plan and Schedule):**
- Domains scoring 2.0-3.0 that align with team goals
- Foundation improvements that enable future growth

**Low Impact, High Urgency (Quick Wins):**
- Simple improvements that boost team morale
- Easy process changes that remove friction

**Low Impact, Low Urgency (Monitor):**
- Areas where the team is already performing well
- Nice-to-have improvements without clear benefit

### Tracking Progress

**Monthly Check-ins:**
- What improvements have we implemented?
- What impact have we observed?
- What obstacles have we encountered?
- What adjustments should we make?

**Quarterly Reassessment:**
- Complete the diagnostic again
- Compare scores to identify trends
- Celebrate improvements and acknowledge progress
- Set priorities for the next quarter

## Advanced Analysis Techniques

### Response Pattern Analysis
Look for patterns in how team members responded:

**Consensus Areas:** Where most responses were similar (within 1 point)
**Divergent Areas:** Where responses varied significantly (2+ points difference)
**Blind Spots:** Where senior and junior members scored very differently

Divergent areas often indicate important discussion topics for the team.

### Correlation Analysis
Look for relationships between domains:

- Do teams with high psychological safety also have better technical practices?
- Is there a correlation between communication scores and goal alignment?
- Do operational excellence scores predict overall team performance?

These correlations can help identify root causes and systemic improvements.

### Benchmark Comparisons
Compare your team's scores to:

- Other teams in your organization
- Industry benchmarks (if available)
- Your team's past performance

Remember that the goal isn't to rank teams but to identify improvement opportunities.
