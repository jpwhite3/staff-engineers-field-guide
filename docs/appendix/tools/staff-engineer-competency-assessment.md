# Staff Engineer Competency Assessment Framework

## Introduction: Your Technical Leadership Journey

This comprehensive assessment helps staff engineers, principal engineers, and technical leaders evaluate their current capabilities across all dimensions of technical leadership. Unlike generic leadership assessments, this framework is specifically designed for the unique challenges and opportunities that senior individual contributors face.

**How to Use This Assessment:**
- Answer honestly based on your current capabilities, not aspirations
- Consider evidence from the past 6 months of your work
- Use this as a baseline for your development planning
