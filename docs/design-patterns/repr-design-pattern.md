# The REPR Design Pattern: A Streamlined Approach to API Development

**Date:** 2021-07-21
**Description:** The REPR (Request-Endpoint-Response) Design Pattern offers a simplified and more focused approach to designing web API endpoints, significantly reducing complexity compared to traditional MVC patterns and promoting a robust, maintainable API architecture.

---

For decades, the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern has served as the cornerstone of UI application development. While undeniably successful in its intended domain, applying MVC to API development often leads to unnecessary complexity. The introduction of ViewModels, complex controllers, and intricate routing mechanisms can create a tangled mess, hindering development velocity and increasing the potential for errors. Think of it like this: MVC is an elegant solution for presenting information to a user, but APIs are fundamentally about _exchanging_ data—a much more direct and streamlined need.

The core issue stems from treating API development as a UI-driven process, when it's fundamentally a data exchange mechanism. Imagine trying to build a railway system with all the added complexity of constructing a train and designing the cabin, when the goal is simply to move goods from point A to point B efficiently.

When you start layering on ViewModels, it becomes a bit like adding a fully furnished passenger cabin to a simple delivery truck. What's the point?

Often, developers stumble upon a pattern where they label API models as “ApiModels,” often just to differentiate them from Data Transfer Objects (DTOs). This isn’t a bad starting point, but it doesn’t fully address the underlying issue: the tendency to treat APIs as if they were UI applications. The problem is exacerbated when you’re dealing with a large system with dozens or hundreds of API endpoints, each with its own associated controller and ViewModel.

The REPR Design Pattern addresses this by advocating for a radically simpler approach: focus on the fundamental components of an API interaction – the Request, the Endpoint, and the Response. Let's break down why this is so powerful.

**Understanding the REPR Components**

- **Request:** This represents the input to the endpoint. It defines the data being sent to the server. This could be a simple object containing parameters, or a complex data structure.
- **Endpoint:** This is a single, focused class responsible for handling a specific API operation. It contains a single method, typically named `Handle` (or something similar), which is responsible for processing the request and generating the response. This is the heart of the endpoint – the logic that executes the core functionality.
- **Response:** This represents the output of the endpoint. It defines the data being returned to the client. This could be a simple success/failure indicator, or a complex data structure representing the results of the operation.

**Example: A Simple Product Retrieval Endpoint**

Let’s consider a scenario where we need to retrieve product information from a database based on a product ID. Using the REPR pattern, we might define the following:

- **Request:** `ProductIdRequest` – A simple class containing a `ProductId` property.
- **Endpoint:** `GetProductEndpoint` – A class with a `Handle` method that takes a `ProductIdRequest` as input, queries the database for a product with the given ID, and returns a `ProductResponse`.
- **Response:** `ProductResponse` – A class containing the product’s details (name, description, price, etc.).

```csharp
// Example C# Code Snippet
public class ProductIdRequest
{
    public int ProductId { get; set; }
}

public class ProductResponse
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public string Description { get; set; }
    public decimal Price { get; set; }
}

public class GetProductEndpoint
{
    public async Task<ProductResponse> Handle(ProductIdRequest request)
    {
        // Simulate database query
        var product = await SimulateDatabaseQuery(request.ProductId);

        return product;
    }

    private async Task<ProductResponse> SimulateDatabaseQuery(int productId)
    {
        // Placeholder for database interaction logic
        await Task.Delay(100);
        return new ProductResponse { Id = productId, Name = "Example Product", Price = 99.99m };
    }
}
```

**Benefits of the REPR Pattern**

- **Reduced Complexity:** Eliminates the need for complex controllers, ViewModels, and routing configurations.
- **Improved Maintainability:** Single-responsibility endpoints are easier to understand, test, and maintain.
- **Increased Velocity:** Faster development cycles due to a simpler architecture.
- **Enhanced Testability:** Easier to write unit tests for individual endpoints.

**Tools & Frameworks**

While the REPR pattern is fundamentally a design philosophy, several frameworks and libraries can help you implement it effectively.

- **Ardalis.ApiEndpoints:** A NuGet package that provides a streamlined way to build API endpoints using the REPR pattern. It offers features like automatic routing and validation.
- **MediatR:** A popular library for handling asynchronous commands and events, which can be useful for coordinating endpoints.

**Conclusion**

The REPR Design Pattern offers a powerful alternative to traditional MVC patterns for API development. By focusing on the fundamental components of a request-response interaction, you can create a more robust, maintainable, and efficient API architecture. Mastering the REPR pattern can significantly reduce development complexity, accelerate development cycles, and ultimately lead to higher-quality APIs.
