This is a placeholder for the Separation of Concerns diagram.

The image should illustrate the concept of separating different aspects of a system into distinct components, such as:
1. User Interface (UI)
2. Business Logic
3. Data Access Layer
4. Infrastructure Layer

Each component should have clear boundaries and responsibilities.
