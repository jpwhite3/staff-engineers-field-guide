# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is the Staff Engineer's Field Guide - a comprehensive, community-driven resource for Staff, Principal, and Distinguished Engineers. The content is organized into a structured learning path covering technical leadership, influence, and execution at senior levels.

## Architecture

**Documentation Structure:**
- `docs/field-guide/` - Core field guide content organized into chapters (Leadership, Engineering, Execution, etc.)
- `docs/appendix/` - Supplementary materials including antipatterns, design patterns, domain-driven design concepts, laws, tools, and values
- `src/` - Source content that may be used for generation or processing
- `mkdocs.yml` - Site navigation and configuration

**Content Organization:**
The guide follows a hierarchical structure with major sections:
- Introduction (archetypes: Tech Lead, Architect, Solver, Right Hand)
- Learning (expertise development, mentorship, staying current)
- Ethics (bias, privacy, frameworks, scale, innovation)
- Leadership (influence, feedback, communication, storytelling)
- Teamwork (formation, dysfunction patterns, collaboration)
- Execution (agile, decision-making, strategy, prioritization)
- Engineering (CI/CD, architecture, security, testing)
- Critical Thinking (mental models, biases, problem-solving)
- Business (alignment, pitching, cost optimization)

## Development Commands

**Bootstrap environment:**
```bash
make bootstrap
```

**Local development:**
```bash
make serve
```
Site will be available at http://127.0.0.1:8000

**Build site:**
```bash
make build
```

**Deploy to GitHub Pages:**
```bash
make deploy
```

## Technology Stack
